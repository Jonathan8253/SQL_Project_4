Create a query to return product_line, the month from date, displayed as 'June', 'July', and 'August', the warehouse, and net_revenue.
* net_revenue is calculated by getting the sum of total and multiplying by 1 - payment_fee, rounding to two decimal places.
* You will need to filter client_type so that only 'Wholesale' orders are returned.
* The results should first be sorted by product_lineand month in ascending order, then by net_revenuein descending order.
